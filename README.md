# Calculator In JavaScript  

This project uses many different concepts which include:
- Flexbox
- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners for mouse clicks and keyboard
- Objects and array methods

Through this project I have been able to put to practice my knowledge of event listeners in creating a dynamically updating calculator. As well as make the buttons visually change upon being pressed on and playing a sound effect to go along.
